## Introduction to python session

### Presentation

The presentation from the first day of the session can be found on this [link](https://slides.com/palashnigam/deck/live#/)


### The road ahead

Now that you have a basic idea of python you should try to venture out into the world of software development on your own and for that we have compiled and list of resources for you.

**NOTE: There is only one way to learn software development by writing software :wink: so if you are just going through these talks and tutorials without trying things out on your own and not writing any code yourself you might as well stop and don't even do that because without writing code you will never learn how to code.**


Before going through the list of resources you can also take a look at the [Hacker Manifesto](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) to become familiar with the hacker culture. It is a big piece of text so don't read it all at one 4-5 paragraphs a week would be enough.


#### Project ideas

If you don't have project ideas of your own you can check out these repos or if you want you can check out the existing projects of other PSoc members from their [profiles](https://github.com/orgs/p-society/people)

- [Project based learning](https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning#python) (If you find this list too advanced take a look at the other two below :smile:)
- [1000 projects list](https://github.com/karan/Projects)
- [1000 mega project list](https://github.com/vicky002/1000_Projects)
